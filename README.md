# MoGo-Template
This is a sample template made from scratch. PSD to HTML work. Can also integrate to WordPress theme.


I would like to acknowledge the following for creating this PSD to HTML MoGo - Creative Template.

Below are the jQuery plugins used all over the site to help it be more functional and interactive.

*FlexSlider-master: For the Testimonial Slider.

*Headhesive.js-master: For the sticky navigation that stays in the top that colorized once the site was scrolled down.

*Imagehover.css-master: For the image hover effects.

*Masonry-master: For the Masonry gallery effects.

*Textillate-master: For the text effect made on the main text on the site banner/ key visual. Along with this Lettering.js-master and animate.css-master was also used to make the effect more effective.

I Would also like to give credits to http://freebiesbug.com/ for the free PSD they have on their website. The sample PSD can be found via this link http://freebiesbug.com/psd-freebies/mogo-free-one-page-psd-template/ which I have as an inspiration for creating this template from the scratch.
